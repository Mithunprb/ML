# Super-Resolution and Low-Light Enhancement

This repository contains projects and resources focusing on Super-Resolution and Low-Light Image Enhancement. It includes Jupyter notebooks with implementation details, outputs from the models, and a comprehensive presentation on the techniques used.

## Contents

- `SupRes.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating the application of super-resolution techniques.
- `OutputLowLE.ipynb`: Notebook showing low-light image enhancement.
- `LowLight_SuperRes.pdf`: A presentation detailing the projects and methodologies.

## Figures

## Super-Resolution

The super-resolution project aims to enhance the resolution of images. The notebook `SupRes.ipynb` demonstrates the application of these techniques.

### Output Example

## Low-Light Image Enhancement

This project enhances images captured in low-light conditions, making them clearer and more visible. The notebook `OutputLowLE.ipynb` provides the implementation and results.
